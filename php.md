- Performance optimization and opcode caching
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Async programming with ReactPHP, Swoole, or OpenSwoole

**Approach:**
1. Use strict types (`declare(strict_types=1)`) in all files
2. Leverage modern PHP features for cleaner, more maintainable code
3. Implement proper type hints for parameters, return values, and properties
4. Follow PSR standards for code style and structure
5. Use static analysis tools to catch errors before runtime

**Approach:**
1. Follow framework conventions and best practices
2. Use dependency injection for loose coupling
3. Implement proper validation and sanitization
4. Create reusable components and services
5. Use migrations for database schema management
6. Implement comprehensive testing strategies

- Dependency injection with service containers

### Performance Considerations
- Opcode caching (OPcache) configuration
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached, APCu)
- Lazy loading and eager loading optimization
- Memory usage optimization and profiling
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Queue management for background processing

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### Laravel Development
- Use Eloquent relationships efficiently with proper eager loading
- Implement Form Requests for validation
- Use Laravel's built-in features (middleware, queues, events, notifications)
- Follow Laravel naming conventions and directory structure
- Use Artisan commands for automation tasks
- Implement proper API resources and pagination
- Use Laravel's testing features (factories, seeders, HTTP tests)

### Symfony Development
- Leverage Symfony components and bundles
- Use dependency injection with service configuration
- Implement event subscribers and listeners
- Use Symfony Forms for complex form handling
- Follow Symfony's bundle structure and conventions
- Use Doctrine for database operations
- Implement security with Symfony Security component

### API Development
- Design RESTful APIs following HTTP standards
- Use proper HTTP status codes and response formats
- Implement API versioning strategies
- Use JSON:API or HAL for hypermedia APIs
- Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth2, API keys)
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
1. Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards
2. Organize code by domain/feature rather than technical layers
3. Use namespaces effectively for code organization
4. Implement proper separation of concerns
5. Create reusable packages and components
6. Use Composer for dependency management
7. Implement proper configuration management

### Error Handling
1. Create custom exception classes with proper hierarchy
2. Use typed exceptions for different error categories
3. Implement global exception handlers
4. Log errors with structured data and context
5. Provide meaningful error messages for APIs
6. Use proper HTTP status codes for web applications
7. Implement circuit breaker patterns for external services

### Security Best Practices
1. Input validation and sanitization (filter_var, validation libraries)
2. SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
3. XSS protection with proper output escaping
4. CSRF protection with tokens
5. Password hashing with password_hash() and verification
6. Secure session management and configuration
7. Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
8. Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Database Best Practices
1. Use migrations for schema changes
2. Implement proper indexing strategies
3. Use database transactions for data consistency

7. Implement proper backup and recovery strategies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- PHPUnit or Pest for test framework
