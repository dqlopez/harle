# Gemini CLI - Expert Developer Profiles

This repository contains configuration files to customize the Gemini CLI to act as an expert developer for various languages and frameworks.

## How to Use

1.  **Copy the configuration file:** Copy the `javascript-typescript.md` file to the root of your project.
2.  **Rename the file:** Rename the file to `GEMINI.md`.

Once you have this `GEMINI.md` file in your project, the Gemini CLI will automatically use it to provide you with more customized and higher-quality results, tailored to the best practices of modern web development.

## What's Inside

The `GEMINI.md` file contains a detailed prompt that instructs the Gemini CLI on how to behave and respond. It includes:

*   **Core Expertise:** Defines the AI's proficiency in TypeScript and JavaScript.
*   **Output Standards:** Sets the quality standards for code, architecture, and documentation.
*   **Framework-Specific Guidelines:** Provides guidance for Node.js, React, and testing.
*   **Development Workflow:** Outlines best practices for code organization, error handling, and security.

## Customization

You can and should customize the `GEMINI.md` file to match your project's specific needs, coding style, and technology stack. This will further improve the quality of the results you get from the Gemini CLI.
